# Sample starter for using wkwebview

Spin up a simple WKWebView based app - with Swift 2 and Xcode 7.2. For some reason there weren't a lot of examples out there when I put this together in January, 2016. I hope it helps you.

I know the code says it is copyrighted, but that is just XCODE boilerplate. This is wide open.
